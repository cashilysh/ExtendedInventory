# Extended Inventory

The default Minecraft inventory was designed when the game had far fewer items. Nowadays, it feels restrictive as it's quickly filling up with junk and making inventory management a hassle.

Shulker boxes and bundles aren’t practical alternatives—they require constant placement, breaking, and micromanagement, disrupting the flow rather than improving it.

#### So I made this mod that permanently adds three inventory rows below the hotbar, expanding storage and simplifying resource management.

**Features:**
Extra inventory slots are stored along the vanilla inventory NBT player data
Vanilla inventory is prefered for item-pickup and crafting outputs (unless full)
Keeps the vanilla ´offHand´ and ´equipment´ slot mappings
Works seamlessly with the ´KeepInventory´ game rule
´quickMove´ (SHIFT-click-move) works with the extra inventory

Uninstalling the mod deletes your extra inventory and its contents permanently (vanilla inventory remains). I’m not responsible for lost items or data corruption. Back up your items/player data before removing or upgrading the mod or Minecraft version.
